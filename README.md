# Wildfly-Swarm Examples

These examples demonstrate utilizing and combining different different parts of WildFly to create
a self-contained executable jar. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used
as a reference for your own project.

The examples require a build of [WildFly Swarm](https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm) HEAD prior to building.

If you want to run the examples against the latest WildFly Swarm release, the example source can be [cloned](https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/tree/1.0.0.Alpha3) or [downloaded](https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/releases/tag/1.0.0.Alpha3).
