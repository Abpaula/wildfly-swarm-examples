= Camel in a `.war`

> Please raise any issues found with this example in our JIRA:

This example demonstrates how to use the default Camel `.war` demo
with WildFly Swarm.

== Project `pomx.xml`

The project is a normal maven project with `war` packaging.

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>war</packaging>
----

The project adds a `<plugin>` to configure `wildfly-swarm-plugin` to
create the runnable `.jar`.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  ....
</plugin>
----

As with the other examples, this one inherits a few standard executions
from the parent `pom.xml`, particularly the `package` execution.

To define the needed parts of WildFly Swarm, a few dependencies are added
to support the `.war` deployment:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>undertow</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Run

You can run it many ways:

* mvn package && java -jar ./target/example-camel-war-swarm.jar
* mvn wildfly-swarm:run
* In your IDE run the `org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm` class
